# Kotlin Multiplatform Ayna Application

This is a basic Kotlin Multiplatform app template for Android and iOS. It includes shared business logic and data handling, and a shared UI implementation using Compose Multiplatform.

> The template is also available [with native UI written in Jetpack Compose and SwiftUI](https://github.com/kotlin/KMP-App-Template-Native).
>
> The [`amper` branch](https://github.com/Kotlin/KMP-App-Template/tree/amper) showcases the same project configured with [Amper](https://github.com/JetBrains/amper).
